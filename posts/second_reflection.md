# Second Reflection
What I learned this week (bullets are fine, you may include an image):

- Topic(s): Digital Citizenship - Internet Safety
- What I struggled with: I struggled with encompassing both physcial consequences and digital consequences of internet safety.
- What Iâ€™m proud of: I'm poud of properly delivering the information as it was very sensitive, but I talked about it in a school-friendly manner
- Next steps: Focus on the bigger picture rather than solely focusing on tiny details, especially in presentations.
