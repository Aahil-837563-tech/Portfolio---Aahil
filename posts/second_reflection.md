# Second Reflection
What I learned this week (bullets are fine, you may include an image):

- Topic(s): Parameters, beginSHape function, mouseX, and mouseY
- What I struggled with: I struggled with the arc function at first but quickly got the hang of it.
- What Iâ€™m proud of: I'm proud of my colour changing chemical and how I used parametres to control the blue value so they look different.
- Next steps: Learn how to animate and add more interactive components.
